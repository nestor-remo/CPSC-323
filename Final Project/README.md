# CPSC 323 COMPILERS PROJECT
## By: Dane Camacho, Abel Daniel, and Nestor Reategui

# How to run:
To run the parser that parses final.txt into final24.txt, run `python3 parser.py`
This removes all comments from the file

To run the equivalent program written by hand in Python, run `python3 translatedProgram.py`

To run the final project that checks whether the file final24.txt follows the given grammar,
run `python3 finalProject.py`

The output of the program will be "The file is valid" or "The file is invalid"
The reason may also be outputted if a keyword is spelled wrong or a terminal is missing
